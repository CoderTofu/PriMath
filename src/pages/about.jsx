                    Primath is a 20-question quiz web-game with the intention to be challenging yet easy to get into.
                    By being based like a quiz game, the game is intended for everyone who knows the four 
                    basic math operations. The tally of points are based on multiple factors: time taken to answer the question,
                    the absolute difference of the two values used, and the type of operation used for the question.

                    Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my website. I started to create this around June 2022.
                    I learned a lot throughout the process of building this site. 
                    If you guys were to ever start encountering bugs, you can hit me up on my socials,
                    and I'll do my best to fix them as fast as I could.
                </p>
                <p className="about-msg">
                    Also, special thanks to the subreddit r/PinoyProgrammer and also the discord peeps from the Programming 
                    Philippines facebook page. Your feedback really helped me reflect on my design choices.
                    Specially on my shortcomings when it comes to code. Check out my socials soon for more of my next projects.
                </p>
